We continue this\\nwork under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\\n\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google\\nServices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s structure is\\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\\n\\nAccess and technology for everyone\\n\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and small.\\nOur mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was\\nwhen we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a\\ncompany that also helps people get things done.\\n\\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they\\nneed to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make\\nsense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides\\npeople with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to\\nget things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person\\'s day, no matter where\\nthey are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock\\nnew growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users,\\npartners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion in research and development in the last\\nfive years in support of these efforts.\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 5/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nMoonshots\\n\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but\\nthose efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We\\ncontinue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the original\\nfounders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our\\nlong-term success.\\n\\nThe power of Al\\n\\nWe believe that Al is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful benefits\\nto people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of\\nhuman endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of advancing\\nthe frontier of Al. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly and boldly\\ndevelop more capable and useful Al every day.\\n\\nAl already powers Google’s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of our\\ncore ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run effective and\\nefficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. Al makes it possible to search in new languages, with multiple\\ninputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular products at\\nGoogle — including Lens and Translate — were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such as optical\\ncharacter recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build Al into numerous solutions that our\\ncustomers can use to develop Al-powered applications — including processing documents, images, and translation — to\\nunderstand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all these\\nexamples, Al significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to people and\\norganizations.\\n\\nOur view is that Al is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough Al\\ninnovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further advancements\\nthat will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity\\'s greatest challenges and opportunities.\\n\\nPrivacy and security\\n\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-\\nterm financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly\\nupholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people\\nin control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving\\nthem new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and\\npassword security features.\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\n\\nServing our users\\n\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in\\nthe world. Google Services\\' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive,\\nGoogle Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the\\nworld.\\n\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.\\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their\\ncomputer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to find what\\nthey are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new.\\n\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and\\ncreation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming\\nmany forms of digital content, including watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books,\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 6/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nand using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to\\nfind great digital content.\\n\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue to\\ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as\\ngrowing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people\\'s lives\\neasier by combining the best of our Al, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of\\nhardware products such as the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and the very first Pixel Watch. Creating products that people\\nrely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\\n\\nHow we make money\\n\\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range\\nof products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the\\nright time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\\n\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on\\nGoogle Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners\\' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We\\ncontinue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so\\nadvertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n\\n* Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement\\nwith advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results.\\nOur ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n\\n¢ Brand advertising helps enhance users\\' awareness of and affinity for advertisers\\' products and services, through\\nvideos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver\\ndigital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\\n\\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We\\nfocus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out\\ninvalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos\\nwhere ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\n\\nWe continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube\\nsubscriptions, such as:\\n\\n* Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\\n\\n+ Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel\\ndevices.\\n\\n+ YouTube non-advertising generates subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\\n\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google\\nCloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity; data,\\nanalytics, Al, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect, protect, and\\nrespond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Our data cloud unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance,\\nand advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. We provide customers an\\nopen, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in\\ntheir data centers. Additionally, Google Workspace\\'s easy-to-use and secure communication and collaboration tools, which\\ninclude apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable secure hybrid work, boosting productivity and\\ncollaboration.\\n\\nOther Bets\\n\\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from\\nimproving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s investment in\\nthe portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D\\nphase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful\\nbusinesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 7/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with\\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries.\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n\\n* general purpose search engines and information services;\\n\\n+ vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may\\nnavigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n\\n* — online advertising platforms and networks;\\n\\n+ other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers\\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n\\n* — digital content and application platform providers;\\n+ providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n\\n* companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have\\ndeveloped proprietary platforms;\\n\\n* providers of digital video services;\\n\\n* — social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through\\ntraditional search engines;\\n\\n* — providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\\n+ — digital assistant providers.\\n\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies\\nto the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and\\nretaining:\\n\\n* users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of\\nour advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n\\n* advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their\\nadvertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n\\n* content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate\\nrevenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\\n\\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\\n\\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our\\ncore values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability\\nand climate change since Google’s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the\\npast two decades:\\n\\n+ In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\\n\\n+ In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy,\\nwhich we have achieved for five consecutive years.\\n\\n+ In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any\\ncompany in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally and\\nsocially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean\\ntransportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small\\nbusinesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net proceeds from our\\nsustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\\n\\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a\\ncircular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\\n\\n7\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 8/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nTo accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate\\naction, and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\\n\\n* achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware\\nproducts;\\n\\n+ become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a\\nyear;\\n\\n* enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\\n\\n+ help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon\\nemissions annually.\\n\\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to\\nenable others to do the same.\\n\\nWe are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We\\nintroduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower\\ncarbon footprints; and when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information\\nfrom authoritative sources like the United Nations.\\n\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by\\n2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing our\\nstewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving\\nwatershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone\\npredict, prevent, and recover from water stress. At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we\\nwill continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have\\nachieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\\n\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\\nGoogle’s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about risks\\nand uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nCulture and Workforce\\n\\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\\n\\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can\\nhave fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care\\nof the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development,\\nresources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation\\nprograms help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to\\ntechnical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality training and support to\\nmanagers to build and strengthen their capabilities-—ranging from courses for new managers, to learning resources that\\nhelp them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\\n\\nAt Alphabet we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a\\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be found in\\nour annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated\\nby reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, Alphabet had 190,234 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee\\nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining an\\nopen culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and we\\ncommunicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\\n\\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not have\\nappropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, content\\nmoderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to\\ncover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 9/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nspecial projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s\\nSupplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working environment\\nfor everyone — employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\\n\\nGovernment Regulation\\n\\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations\\ncovering a wide variety of subjects. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both\\nU.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of these laws and\\nregulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Particularly with\\nregard to data privacy and security; content moderation; competition; consumer protection; climate change and\\nsustainability; and reporting on human capital and diversity, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and\\nregulations, as well as related enforcement actions, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative bodies\\naround the world.\\n\\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase\\nour cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models,\\ncause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an\\nadverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A;\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part Il, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our\\nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international\\ntrademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign\\ncountries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in\\nthe past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.

RISK FACTORS\\n\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those\\ndescribed below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the\\ntrading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\\n\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\n\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss\\nof partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads\\ncould harm our business.\\n\\nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers, companies\\nthat distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at\\nany time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 10/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as\\nchanges to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the\\nadvertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more\\ndifficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these\\ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide\\nsuperior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic\\nconditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts\\nour advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are\\nuseful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies,\\nshifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately\\nanticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a\\ntimely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products\\nand services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance\\nour technology and new and existing products and services.\\n\\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors\\nrange from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and\\nwell established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our\\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D and in talent, initiating\\nintellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete for users, advertisers,\\ncustomers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known\\ncompetitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive\\nadvantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may\\nforesee the need for products and services before us.\\n\\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and existing\\ntechnologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen\\nto be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and\\nforce us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products\\nand services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users,\\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The\\ninvestments that we are making across our businesses, such as in Al, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide\\nproducts and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments\\nspan a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or\\nmay not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities.\\nThese endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management\\nattention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may\\nfail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\\n\\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and\\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\nin performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be\\nno assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\\n\\n10\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 11/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to\\nsupport cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force.\\nAt the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models\\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business\\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory\\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or\\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may\\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other\\ncountries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\\n\\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our\\nofferings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to\\ncompete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\\n\\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use Al, require significant investment and\\nraise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for\\nour products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that\\nsuch strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating\\nmargin in the future.\\n\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices\\nand modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in\\nadvertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our products\\nand services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\\n\\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,\\nsuch as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware,\\nGoogle Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins\\nlower than those we generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our hardware products have had, and may\\ncontinue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We\\nmay also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition,\\nand increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less\\nvariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in conjunction with our efforts to re-engineer\\ncosts, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or these efforts may not be successful. Due to these\\nfactors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not\\nbe indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics in Part Il, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our\\nproducts, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\\n\\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.\\nVarious events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services,\\nand technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our\\nproducts and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our\\nproprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is\\npossible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or\\ncopyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope\\nof the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\\n\\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other\\nsensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these\\ntrade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could\\nbecome so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is\\na protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\\n\\n11\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 12/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other\\npeople using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\\n\\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also,\\nprotecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our\\nintellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\\n\\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors,\\nincluding, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues\\nand developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the\\nsharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by\\nadvertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\\n\\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\\noperating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide\\nhigh-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of\\nsettings.\\n\\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results.\\n\\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to\\nsupply both our products and our services.\\n\\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our hardware products and servers and networking\\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to\\nassemble the hardware products and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the distribution of our\\nproducts and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the\\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to\\nfinancial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements\\nwith them.\\n\\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead\\ntimes that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity,\\nlabor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and\\nexport controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the\\neffects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects\\nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes\\nin the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical\\ninfrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find\\nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that\\naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability.\\n\\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions.\\nWe may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change,\\nchanged consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our\\nhardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware\\nsales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other\\nfinancial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and\\noperating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on\\nvolume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.\\n\\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing,\\nor operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\\n\\n12\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 13/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nmanufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or\\nservices are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and\\npractices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security,\\nenvironmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of\\nlaw or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships,\\nand damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our\\nability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\\n\\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications\\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or\\npandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\\nheat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased\\nstorm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer\\ndenial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers\\nare located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to\\nbreak-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems\\nexperienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area.\\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The\\noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data\\ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and\\ncomplex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in\\ninterruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively\\noffering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results.\\n\\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow\\ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. In addition\\nto risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\\n\\n* restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us\\nfrom repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\\n\\n+ import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from\\noffering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies\\nand finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs;\\n\\n+ longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\\n\\n* an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new\\nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that\\nwe are unable to effectively anticipate;\\n\\n* sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to comply\\nwith local laws, including as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in\\nUkraine;\\n\\n+ political unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of our\\nproducts and services, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and\\nservices, or may impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market;\\n\\n+ anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\\n\\n13\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 14/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n* uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty as a result of local laws,\\ninsufficient due process, and lack of legal precedent; and\\n\\n+ — different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges\\ncaused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\\n\\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we\\nhave faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a\\nportion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and\\nforeign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could\\nexpose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\\nstatements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time.\\n\\nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively\\naffected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign\\nexchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark\\nrates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\\n\\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based\\ncompensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business\\ncombination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation\\nmethods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. We\\nadjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or\\nsimilar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, are\\nrecognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The unrealized gains\\nand losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may\\ndiffer significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments.\\n\\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and\\noperating results.\\n\\nRisks Related to our Industry\\n\\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the\\nadvancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our\\nproducts and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\\n\\nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones,\\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-\\nstreaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor\\nmay establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only\\nbe available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers\\nmay also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-\\nactivated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges\\nwe may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We\\nexpect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple\\nplatforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers,\\ndistributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and\\nplatforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business\\nopportunities.\\n\\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation,\\ncause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products\\nand services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could\\nresult in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ and customers’ ability to\\nuse our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\\n\\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure,\\nor security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and\\nregulations regarding privacy and data change.\\n\\n14\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 15/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive\\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches\\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other\\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products\\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are\\nlikely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and may in\\nthe future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and control failures,\\nsecurity breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in\\ngovernment and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and\\nretain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature\\nof our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect\\nto continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and\\nsecurity vulnerabilities or breaches.\\n\\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of\\ntime. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j\\nvulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to\\nexperience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may\\nalso increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-\\nsponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including\\nfederal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,\\nmay increase these risks.\\n\\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or\\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time\\nthey occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant\\nlegal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative\\npublicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the\\naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the techniques used to\\nobtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently\\nand often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including\\nthose required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or\\nvulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\\n\\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our\\nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business\\npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would\\nbe harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised,\\nand we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action\\nlitigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business,\\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related to\\nLaws, Regulations, and Policies’ below.\\n\\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our\\nplatforms and misuse of user data.\\n\\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a\\nresult of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to\\nor misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties.

Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our\\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad\\npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading\\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may\\nremedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and\\nreputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also\\nno guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they\\nmay not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.\\n\\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such\\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and\\nbrands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our\\nbusiness and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries,\\nwhich could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\\'s time and attention, and lead to enhanced\\nregulatory oversight.\\n\\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our\\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\\n\\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated\\nattempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to\\notherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to\\npromote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been\\nunable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content.\\n\\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\\nsearch results than our search engine\\'s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or\\nundesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most\\nother languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings.\\nWe continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for\\nspam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect\\nand prevent web spam on our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites,\\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their\\nsearch rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from low-quality\\nwebsites. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents\\nsuch as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and\\nthe spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\\n\\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it\\ncould hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition\\nand operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties\\nand damages and divert management\\'s time and attention.\\n\\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\\n\\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have\\ntaken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to\\ncertain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by\\ncharging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access.\\nSome jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers;\\nhowever, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 the\\nU.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\\n\\n16\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 17/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content\\nproviders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting\\nour business.\\n\\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\\n\\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm\\nour business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to\\nexpand our business.\\n\\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws\\nand regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, and\\nonline content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\\n\\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services,\\naltered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services,\\nsubstantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\\n\\n* Competition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology\\nplatforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea and elsewhere\\nthat affect Google Play\\'s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under consideration in a\\nrange of jurisdictions.\\n\\n+ Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing,\\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the\\nprocessing of children\\'s data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data\\ntransfers (including data localization laws).\\n\\n+ Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright\\nin the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing\\nregimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create\\nproperty rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.\\n\\n* Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations,\\nsuch as the EU\\'s Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and laws and proposed\\nlegislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain\\ntypes of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may\\nmake it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or\\nharmful content.\\n\\n+ Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could\\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\n\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts, remain\\nuncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like\\nthose set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and\\nthe E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and\\nhosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose\\nsignificant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v.\\nGoogle), EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online\\nplatforms.\\n\\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations,\\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our\\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders\\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our\\nplatforms, personal injury, and other matters.

Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for\\ndefamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity,\\ntorts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or\\nvia our services or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content\\ncreated by third parties.\\n\\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Justice, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust\\nlawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and\\ndistribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other\\nregulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and\\ndata protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with\\nlaws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation where appropriate. Various\\nlaws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past, and may in the future\\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other\\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and\\nother harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that\\nrequires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution of\\none or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties,\\ninjunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or\\nalleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\n\\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have\\nresulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and\\ncould continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance\\nobligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in\\nways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\\n\\n+ The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which\\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or\\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the\\nmonitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\\n\\n+ Various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the\\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the\\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which give new data privacy rights to\\ntheir respective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting\\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant\\nobligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\\n\\n+ State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act\\nand the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that collect or\\ndisclose consumer biometric information.\\n\\n+ Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children\\nand minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the Children’s\\nOnline Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the California Age\\nAppropriate Design Code, all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors\\nand impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.\\n\\n+ The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\\ninternet-connected devices.\\n\\n18\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 19/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ The EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data\\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other\\nchanges.\\n\\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we\\ncan transfer, process and/or receive personal data. Previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S. and\\nthe Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and storage, such\\nas Standard Contractual Clauses, remain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt our existing\\ncontractual arrangements. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and\\npolitical developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption of the U.S.-EU Data Privacy\\nFramework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and ongoing\\nenforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm our ability to\\nprocess and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our ability to provide,\\nand our customers’ ability to use, some of our products and services.\\n\\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use\\ncertain technologies.\\n\\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of\\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks.\\nParties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S.\\nInternational Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies\\nmay frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to\\nexpand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as\\nwe develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\\n\\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for\\nus and otherwise harm our business.\\n\\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against\\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property\\ninfringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if\\nthere were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our\\nproducts, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and\\nharm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not\\ncover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims.\\nFurthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification\\nfor certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits,\\nintellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are\\nsuccessful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\n\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to\\npotential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.\\n\\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to\\nmatters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords\\nrelating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and\\nformalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure\\nrequirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced\\na number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments,\\nand our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or\\nperformance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or\\nperceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and\\nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\n\\n19\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 20/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our\\neffective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different\\nstatutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management\\nprogram, decreases in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our\\ndeferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations,\\nor accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect\\ntaxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are\\nlevied against third parties.\\n\\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have\\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as\\ntransfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\\nharm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to\\nadditional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and\\nother tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are\\nreasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our\\nfinancial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\n\\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may\\nbe subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various jurisdictions\\naround the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted\\ntaxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for\\nEconomic Cooperation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules.\\n\\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\\n\\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\\ndiminish our cash reserves.\\n\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further,\\nour share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be\\nsuspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\n\\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\\n\\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no\\nvoting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our\\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock.\\nThrough their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\\nincluding the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or\\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required\\nby applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund\\nemployee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to\\nelect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share\\nrepurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This\\nconcentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take\\nactions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock\\nand our Class C stock.\\n\\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders\\nmay consider favorable.\\n\\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\\n\\n+ Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n\\n* Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a\\nstockholders’ meeting.\\n\\n20\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 21/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\\n\\n+ Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to\\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a\\npotential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\\'s own slate of directors or otherwise\\nattempting to obtain control of our company.\\n\\n+ Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which\\nmakes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that\\ncould impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\\n\\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a\\ncorporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock\\nunless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the\\ntransaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\\n\\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\\n\\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In\\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated,\\nand may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including,\\namong others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world.\\nThese broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock,\\nregardless of our actual operating performance.\\n\\nGeneral Risks\\n\\nThe continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact are highly unpredictable and could be\\nsignificant, and could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the\\nmacroeconomic impacts resulting from COVID-19, and as a result, our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage\\nof our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results may fall\\nbelow expectations. The extent to which our business will continue to be affected will depend on a variety of factors, many\\nof which are outside of our control, including the persistence of the pandemic, impacts on economic activity, and the\\npossibility of recession or continued financial market instability.\\n\\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results\\nto fall short of expectations.\\n\\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many\\noutside of our control, including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result,\\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may\\nnot be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Consequently,\\nour operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\\n\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and\\nother consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to\\ncontinue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could\\ncreate unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\\n\\n+ diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\\nother strategic transactions;\\n\\n+ failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed\\nupon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise\\nrestrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\\n\\n+ failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural\\nintegration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\\n\\n+ implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\\n\\n21\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 22/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ integration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of\\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\\n\\n+ transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\\n\\n+ in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to\\naddress the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\\n\\n+ failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments and joint ventures;\\n+ failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\\n\\n+ — liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement\\nclaims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims,\\nproduct liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\\n\\n+ — litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees,\\ncustomers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\\n\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions\\nand other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and\\nharm our business generally.\\n\\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the\\nincurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived\\nassets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the\\nanticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our\\ndivestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which\\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\\n\\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management\\nteam. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an\\nimportant role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. All of our\\nexecutive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance\\npolicies. The loss of key personnel could harm our business.\\n\\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified\\npersonnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate\\neffectively.\\n\\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete\\neffectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled\\npersonnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our\\ncompetitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. In addition, our compensation\\narrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and\\nretaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our\\nability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.\\n\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization\\ngrows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our\\ncorporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or\\npandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate\\nculture. As we experiment with hybrid work models, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to\\npotential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.\\n\\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\\nOPERATIONS\\n\\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with\\n“Note about Forward-Looking Statements,” Part |, tem 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated\\nfinancial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nWe have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item\\n7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\n\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google\\nServices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our\\nsegments, see Part |, Item 1 “Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\\n\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that\\nthey will continue to affect our future results:\\n\\n* Users\\' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\\n\\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues\\nsince inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues,\\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising\\nrevenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and\\nadvertisers, which may affect our revenues.\\n\\n« Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows\\nfor new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\\n\\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart\\nhome devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on\\nexpanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\\n\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may\\nbe affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased\\nmarket saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\n\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and\\nTAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix;\\npartner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the\\nrelative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\n\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n\\n« As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\\nmonetization.\\n\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand\\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads\\non YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop new products\\nincorporating Al innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when developing new products and\\nservices we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\\n\\n¢ As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates\\naffect such revenues.\\n\\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products\\nand advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\\n\\n26\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 27/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\n\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed\\nto reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\\n\\n* The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may\\nadversely affect our margins.\\n\\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our\\nproducts and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our\\nadvertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n\\n* As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\\ncapital expenditures.\\n\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\\ndevelop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to continue to\\ninvest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our\\nbusiness and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of Al. In addition acquisitions and strategic investments\\ncontribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and\\nbuild strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of\\nMandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.\\n\\n¢ We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our\\nbusiness practices and financial results.\\n\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range\\nof topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global\\ntrends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain\\nproducts or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples include the antitrust\\ncomplaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; pending litigation in the U.S.,\\nEU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the\\nDigital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large\\ntechnology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part Il, Item 8.\\n\\n* Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\\n\\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring\\ntalented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see\\nCulture and Workforce in Part |, Item 1 “Business.”\\n\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\\n\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for\\nsubscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our revenues\\nhave been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\\n\\n+ changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n* changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\\n\\n* general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other\\nmeasures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\\n\\n* new product and service launches; and\\n\\n27\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 28/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n* seasonality.\\n\\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other\\nsources (\"Google other revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected\\nby other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\\n\\nGoogle Services\\n\\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues.\\nGoogle Advertising\\n\\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\\n\\n* Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from\\ntraffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars,\\netc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n\\n+ YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\\n\\n* Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\n\\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising\\nrevenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-\\nper-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\\n\\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search\\nproperties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-\\nclick is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we\\ncharge advertisers for each engagement by users.\\n\\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob,\\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided\\nby our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression\\ndisplayed to users.\\n\\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and\\ncounting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the\\ncorresponding click and impression activity.\\n\\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation\\nbetween these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:\\n\\n* advertiser competition for keywords;\\n* changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\\n* changes in device mix;\\n\\n* seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as\\ntraditional retail seasonality; and\\n\\n* — traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.\\nGoogle Other\\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\\n\\n* Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n\\n+ hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\\n\\n* YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV; and\\n\\n* — other products and services.\\n\\n28\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 29/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nFluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as\\nchanges in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\\n* Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\\n\\n* Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises,\\nsuch as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\\n\\n+ — other enterprise services.\\n\\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as\\ncustomer usage.\\n\\nOther Bets\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\\nCosts and Expenses\\n\\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include\\ncosts related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses,\\nincluding those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating\\nexpenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue.\\n\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n+ TAC includes:\\n\\ne Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our\\ndistribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and\\nsoftware developers.\\n\\n° Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n+ Other cost of revenues includes:\\n\\ne Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other\\ncontent for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on\\nrevenues generated or a flat fee).\\n\\ne Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation,\\nenergy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as\\ncustomer and product support costs).\\n\\ne Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\\n\\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher\\nthan TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, because most of\\nthe advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\\n\\nOperating Expenses\\n\\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either R&D,\\nsales and marketing, or general and administrative.\\n\\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\\n\\n* compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing and\\nnew products and services;\\n\\n* depreciation; and\\n\\n+ third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and\\nproduct development efforts.\\n\\n29\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 30/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\\n\\n* compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer\\nservice functions; and\\n\\n* spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\\n\\n* compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other\\nadministrative support functions;\\n\\n* expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\\n* third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\n\\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange\\ngains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and\\nincome (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\\n\\nFor additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the\\nvalue of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part Il,\\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\\nRisk’.\\n\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\n\\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in\\nthe U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for additional information.\\n\\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the\\nform of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\\'s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All\\nprior period references made to share or per share amounts throughout this Management\\'s Discussion and\\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations prior to the effective date have been retroactively\\nadjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\n\\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia and\\neffectively ceased business activities of our Russian entity. The ongoing effect of these direct actions on our\\nfinancial results was not material. The broader economic effects resulting from the war in Ukraine on our future\\nfinancial results may be unpredictable.\\n\\nRepurchases of Class A and Class C shares were $59.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note\\n11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\\nadditional information.\\n\\nOperating cash flow was $91.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nCapital expenditures, which primarily reflected investments in technical infrastructure, were $31.5 billion for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 190,234 employees.\\n\\nAdditionally, looking ahead to fiscal year 2023:\\n\\nIn January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce of approximately 12,000 roles. We expect to incur\\nemployee severance and related charges of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the majority of which will be recognized in\\nthe first quarter of 2023.\\n\\nIn addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. As a result we expect to incur exit costs\\nrelating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur additional\\ncharges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.\\n\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting\\nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect\\nto result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service\\nas of December 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses.\\n\\nAs Al is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in\\nJanuary 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet\\'s Al activities.

Growth was\\nadversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\\n\\nYouTube ads\\n\\nYouTube ads revenues increased $398 million from 2021 to 2022. The growth was driven by our brand advertising\\nproducts followed by direct response products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers as well\\nas improvements to ad formats and delivery. Growth was adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency\\nexchange rates.\\n\\nGoogle Network\\n\\nGoogle Network revenues increased $1.1 billion from 2021 to 2022.

The growth in YouTube non-\\nadvertising was largely due to an increase in paid subscribers. The growth in hardware was primarily driven by increased\\nsales of Pixel devices. The decrease in Google Play revenues was primarily driven by the fee structure changes we\\nannounced in 2021 as well as a decrease in buyer spending. Additionally, the overall increase in Google other revenues\\nwas adversely affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\\n\\nGoogle Cloud revenues increased $7.1 billion from 2021 to 2022. The growth was primarily driven by Google Cloud\\nPlatform followed by Google Workspace offerings. Google Cloud\\'s infrastructure and platform services were the largest\\ndrivers of growth in Google Cloud Platform.\\n\\nRevenues by Geography\\n\\nThe following table presents revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the\\naddresses of our customers:\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2021 2022\\n\\nUnited States 46% 48 %\\nEMEA 31% 29 %\\nAPAC 18% 16%\\nOther Americas 5% 6%\\nHedging gains (losses) 0% 1%\\n\\nFor further details on revenues by geography, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\\nin Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nUse of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information\\n\\nInternational revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple\\ncurrencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\\n\\nThe effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period\\ncomparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage\\nchange in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational\\ndecision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a\\nconstant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve the\\nability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of\\nour core operating results.\\n\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period\\nover period.

As permitted\\nby the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have taxes payable\\nof $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022.\\n\\nPurchase Commitments\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3\\nbillion was short-term. These amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation\\nfee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network\\ncapacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any\\nminimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022.\\n\\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy\\nattributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The\\namounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily\\ndeterminable.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates\\nand assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the\\ntime the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our\\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base\\nour estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we\\nevaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and\\nCompliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\\n\\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\\n\\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require\\nquantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing\\nadjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best\\ninformation available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\\n\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\\ncompanies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment\\nexist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an\\nincome approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee\\nrevenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative\\nremeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\\n\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of\\nunobservable inputs.\\n\\nProperty and Equipment\\n\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other\\nchanges occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and\\nutilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to\\nbenefit from the assets.\\n\\n39\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 40/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our\\nuncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\n\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable\\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions\\nperiodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well\\nas the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain\\ntax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that\\nthe final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for\\nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\\n\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered\\nappropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of\\nour income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments\\nagainst us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to\\ndetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\n\\nLoss Contingencies\\n\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include\\nspeculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is\\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is\\nreasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has\\nbeen previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and\\nchanges to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the\\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to\\nloss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\\n\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\n\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in\\na change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result\\nin a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December\\n31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the useful lives of our servers\\nand network equipment.\\n\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and\\nequity investment risks.\\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\n\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.\\ndollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen.\\nFor the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency\\nexchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be\\nexperienced.\\n\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce,\\nbut do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The\\nforeign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are\\noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\n\\n40\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 41/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $285 million and $136 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the\\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\\n\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts\\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these\\ncontracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate\\nchanges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into\\nrevenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\\n\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our\\ncash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021 and\\n2022. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in\\nforecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\n\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\\nrelated to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk\\nfrom our foreign operations.\\n\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million lower\\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a\\ncorresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain\\nliquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed\\nand asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we limit\\nthe amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning\\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due\\nto a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.\\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to\\ninterest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value\\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for which we\\nhave not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less\\nany expected credit losses.\\n\\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of\\nour marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and\\n2022 are shown below (in millions):\\n\\n12-Month Average\\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\\n\\n2021 2022 2021 2022\\nRisk category - interest rate $ 139 $ 256 $ 148 $ 198\\n\\n \\n\\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with\\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not\\nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\n\\nEquity Investment Risk\\n\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could\\nsubstantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\n\\n41\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 42/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\n\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\\nrepresent $7.8 billion and $5.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical\\nadverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity\\nsecurities by $516 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our\\nmarketable equity securities.\\n\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early\\nstages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically\\nin the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result\\nin a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in private\\ncompanies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions at\\nlower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in additional volatility.\\nThe success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize\\nappreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or\\nother market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes\\nin valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the carrying value of our non-marketable\\nequity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31,\\n2021 and 2022, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired\\nif the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\n\\nFor further information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n42\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 43/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nITEM 8.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\\nstatements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\nFebruary 2,

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\n\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the\\nsuccessor issuer to Google.\\n\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of\\nother products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based\\nproducts.\\n\\nBasis of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under\\nthe variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets,\\nand goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent\\nliabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to\\nbe reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\\nliabilities.\\n\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network\\nequipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\\n\\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one\\nstock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C\\nstock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of\\nour Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period\\nreferences made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable\\ndisclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the\\ncollectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar\\ntaxes are excluded from revenues.\\n\\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n\\n* Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who\\nuse Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n\\n* YouTube properties; and\\n\\n+ Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense,\\nand Google Ad Manager.\\n\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google\\nMarketing Platform, among others.\\n\\n52\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 53/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance\\nadvertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we\\nrecognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\\n\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a\\ngross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on\\nGoogle Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and\\namounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to\\nour customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n* Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\\n\\n* Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises,\\nsuch as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\\n\\n+ — other enterprise services.\\n\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms\\nlonger than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the\\ncustomer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided\\non a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits\\nof the cloud services.\\n\\nGoogle Other Revenues\\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\\n* Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n+ hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\\n\\n+ YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV; and\\n\\n+ other products and services.\\n\\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance\\nobligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\\n\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\n\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone\\nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\\n\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\n\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We\\nestimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe\\nthat there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\n\\nSales Commissions\\n\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is\\none year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to\\nexceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and\\nmarketing expenses.\\n\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n+ TAC includes:\\n\\n53\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 54/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\ne Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our\\ndistribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and\\nsoftware developers.\\n\\ne Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n+ Other cost of revenues includes:\\n\\n° Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other\\ncontent for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on\\nrevenues generated or a flat fee).\\n\\ne Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation,\\nenergy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as\\ncustomer and product support costs).\\n\\ne Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\n\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of\\nproducts to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological\\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the\\ncriteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were\\nnot material for the periods presented.\\n\\nStock-based Compensation\\n\\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified\\nand measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the\\nstraight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\n\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by\\nus on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income\\ntax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\n\\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs)\\nthat include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain\\nOther Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet\\nawards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based\\non the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\\n\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\n\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9 billion,\\nand $9.2 billion, respectively.\\n\\nPerformance Fees\\n\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in\\nexpense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of\\nunobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements\\n\\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is\\ndetermined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and\\n\\n54\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 55/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on\\nthe observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\\n\\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\\n\\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all\\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable,\\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\n\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\n\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation\\nmethods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\n\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\n\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain\\nOther Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\\n\\nCredit Risks\\n\\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, including\\nforeign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of\\nour counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are\\ntransacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are\\nderived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by\\nperforming ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do\\nnot require collateral from our customers.\\n\\nCash Equivalents\\n\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed\\nsecurities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\n\\nMarketable Securities\\n\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on\\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt\\nsecurities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and\\naccounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives,\\nas well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these\\nsecurities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months\\nas current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities\\nat fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for\\nthe changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other income (expense), net. For certain\\nmarketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other\\nincome (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific\\nidentification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\\nincluding unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net. We classify our marketable equity securities subject\\n\\n55\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 56/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nto long-term lock-up restrictions beyond twelve months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNon-Marketable Securities\\n\\nWe account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have\\ncontrol over the investee under the equity method, All other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily\\naccounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at\\ncost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for\\nidentical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as\\nof the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\\n\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\\nAccounts Receivable\\n\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or\\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services\\nand customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts\\nreceivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\\n\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of\\nIncome. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist\\nand on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining\\nthe amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make\\njudgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-\\nspecific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have commercial\\narrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements, whether the\\narrangements and each component of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the\\napplicable GAAP, as well as the determination of the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value\\nof the investments.\\n\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\\n\\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other\\nincome (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are\\nrecognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security\\nin an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other\\nindicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by\\nrecording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative\\nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\n\\n56\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 57/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nInventory\\n\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\\n\\nVariable Interest Entities\\n\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the\\nprimary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or\\nbenefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in\\naccordance with applicable GAAP.\\n\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of\\nwhether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\\n\\nProperty and Equipment\\n\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data\\ncenters, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment.\\nConstruction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\\nservice.\\n\\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We\\ndepreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over\\nperiods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We depreciate\\nleasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\\nDepreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences\\nonce they are ready for our intended use.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease\\ncomponents. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include\\npayments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and\\naccount for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\\n\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease\\nassets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on\\nwind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\\n\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and\\nin economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or\\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-\\ncancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease\\npayments and lease incentives.\\n\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included\\nin operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are\\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\n\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\\n\\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest\\nlevel of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\\n\\n57\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 58/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to\\ngenerate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as\\nthe amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate\\nour reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually,\\nor more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments\\nwere not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis generally\\nover periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross intangible\\nassets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events\\nthat have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all\\navailable evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that\\nthey will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as\\na current period expense.\\n\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical\\nmerits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial\\nstatements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon\\nsettlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a\\ncomponent of the income tax provision.\\n\\nBusiness Combinations\\n\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-\\nrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\n\\nForeign Currency\\n\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\\nrevenues, costs, and expenses.

We expect to recognize\\napproximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized\\nthereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced\\nin future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\n\\nDeferred Revenue\\n\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\\namounts which are refundable.

However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could\\nbe significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\\npossible.\\n\\nLegal Matters\\n\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated,\\nwe disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of\\nliability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\\nadjustments as appropriate.\\n\\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant judgment\\nis required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such\\nmatters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding\\nlegal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\n\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Investigations\\n\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-\\nrelated complaints against us.\\n\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and\\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion\\n($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on\\nSeptember 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC\\'s decision. We\\nrecognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court\\nrejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\n\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution\\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018)\\nfine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on\\nOctober 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the\\nGeneral Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court\\nof Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had\\nwith AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7\\nbillion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners\\' agreements, which we\\nimplemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized\\na charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by\\nregulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\\n\\n74\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 75/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that\\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the Australian\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom\\'s Competition and Markets Authority\\n(CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n\\n* On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\\nfor the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade\\nlaws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state\\nAttorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate\\nU.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s advertising\\ntechnology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\\n\\n* On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust\\nlaws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened\\ninvestigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play\\'s billing\\npractices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google\\'s compliance with the new app store\\nbilling regulations.\\n\\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with\\nfederal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\n\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\n\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our\\nbusiness practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and\\notherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an\\nimportant forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition\\non importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could\\nhave an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or\\nnecessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain\\nintellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may\\nrequire that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and\\npartners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which\\ncould result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders\\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our\\nplatforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently have a number of privacy\\ninvestigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to\\nrelevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other\\nproceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and\\nauditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and\\ncollateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties\\nhave been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of\\nsanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\n\\n75\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 76/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nNon-Income Taxes\\n\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale\\nof our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-\\nincome taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss\\nis probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can\\nbe estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters\\nand judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.\\n\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.\\nNote 11. Stockholders’ Equity\\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\\n\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to\\nvoting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is\\nentitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of\\nClass B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale\\nor transfer to Class A common stock.\\n\\nStock Split\\n\\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the\\nform of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\\'s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior\\nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and\\napplicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for further\\ndetails.\\n\\nShare Repurchases\\n\\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class\\nA and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\\nrepurchases.\\n\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022\\n\\nShares Amount Shares Amount\\nClass A share repurchases 24 $ 3,399 61 $ 6,719\\nClass C share repurchases 383 46,875 469 52,577\\nTotal share repurchases 407 $ 50,274 530 $ 59,296\\n\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices\\nand volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business\\nand market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated\\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\\n\\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\\n\\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities\\noutstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted\\nearnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of\\nClass A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\\nassume the conversion of those shares.\\n\\n76\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 77/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are\\nidentical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share\\ndividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our\\ncertificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given\\nclass of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our\\ncertificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be\\napproved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are\\nallocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the\\nyear had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a\\nproportionate basis.\\n\\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, the net income per share amounts are the same for\\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or\\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and\\nClass C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2020\\nClass A Class B Class C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 17,733 $ 2,732 $ 19,804\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 5,996 924 6,696\\nBasic net income per share $ 2.96 §$ 2.96 $ 2.96\\nDiluted net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation $ 17,733 $ 2,732 $ 19,804\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\\nshares 2,732 0 0\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings (180) (25) 180\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 20,285 $ 2,707 $ 19,984\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation 5,996 924 6,696\\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding 924 0 0\\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 2 0 123\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 6,922 924 6,819\\nDiluted net income per share $ 2.93 §$ 2.93 $ 2.93\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n77\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 78/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2021\\nClass A Class B Class C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 34,200 $ 5,174 $ 36,659\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 6,006 909 6,438\\nBasic net income per share $ 5.69 §$ 5.69 $ 5.69\\nDiluted net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation $ 34,200 $ 5,174 $ 36,659\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\\nshares 5,174 0 0\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings (581) (77) 581\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 38,793 $ 5,097 $ 37,240\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation 6,006 909 6,438\\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding 909 0 0\\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 0 0 200\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 6,915 909 6,638\\nDiluted net income per share $ 5.61\\n\\n \\n\\n5.61 §$ 5.61\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2022\\nClass A Class B Class C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 27,518 §$ 4,072 $ 28,382\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 5,994 887 6,182\\nBasic net income per share $ 459 §$ 459 §$ 4.59\\nDiluted net income per share: TT\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation $ 27,518 §$ 4,072 $ 28,382\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A\\nshares 4,072 0 0\\nReallocation of undistributed earnings (230) (30) 230\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings $ 31,360 $ 4,042 $ 28,612\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation 5,994 887 6,182\\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding 887 0 0\\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares 0 0 96\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation 6,881 887 6,278\\nDiluted net income per share $ 456 §$ 456 $ 4.56\\n78\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm\\n\\n79/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nNote 13.

We continue to reassess\\nthe remaining valuation allowance quarterly, and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation\\nallowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\\n\\n81\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 82/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n \\n\\n2020 2021 2022\\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,377 $ 3,837 $ 5,158\\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions 372 529 253\\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions (557) (263) (437)\\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities (45) (329) (140)\\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 690 1,384 2,221\\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,837 $ 5,158 $ 7,055\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our\\nuncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax\\nbenefits was $3.8 billion, $5.2 billion, and $7.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, of which\\n$2.6 billion, $3.7 billion, and $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we accrued $270 million and $346 million in interest and penalties in provision\\nfor income taxes, respectively.\\n\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major\\ntax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns\\nby the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also\\nreceived tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent\\nestablishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\\n\\nThe tax years 2015 through 2021 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish\\ntax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\\n\\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy\\nof our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the\\neffect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\\n\\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are\\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management\\'s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for\\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not\\ncertain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax\\npositions could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include\\nvarious U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\\n\\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\\n\\n* Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google\\nPlay, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and in-\\napp purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV.\\n\\n* Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise\\ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google\\nWorkspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\\n\\n+ Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other\\nBets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\\n\\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities,\\nand hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature\\nof Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a\\nconsolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a\\nservice cost generally based on usage or headcount.\\n\\n82\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 83/92\\n\\x0chttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm\\n\\n12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nUnallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal,\\n\\nincluding certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. Additionally,\\nhedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.\\n\\nAs Al is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in\\nJanuary 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of Alphabet\\'s Al activities. DeepMind, previously\\nreported within Other Bets, will be reported as part of Alphabet\\'s corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration with\\nGoogle Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of\\nthe period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31,\\n2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide\\nreasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act\\nis recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that\\nsuch information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief\\nfinancial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\n\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\\nDecember 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting.\\n\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation,\\nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\\nManagement reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. The effectiveness of our\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent\\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\n\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired\\ncontrol objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are\\nresource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls\\nand procedures relative to their costs.\\n\\nITEM 9B.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\n\\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders’ letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do\\nnot intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle\\nbig problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence (Al). We continue this\\nwork under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\\n\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google\\nServices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s structure is\\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\\n\\nAccess and technology for everyone\\n\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and small.\\nOur mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was\\nwhen we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a\\ncompany that also helps people get things done.\\n\\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they\\nneed to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make\\nsense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides\\npeople with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to\\nget things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person\\'s day, no matter where\\nthey are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock\\nnew growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users,\\npartners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion in research and development in the last\\nfive years in support of these efforts.\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 5/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nMoonshots\\n\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but\\nthose efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We\\ncontinue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the original\\nfounders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our\\nlong-term success.\\n\\nThe power of Al\\n\\nWe believe that Al is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful benefits\\nto people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of\\nhuman endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of advancing\\nthe frontier of Al. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly and boldly\\ndevelop more capable and useful Al every day.\\n\\nAl already powers Google’s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of our\\ncore ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run effective and\\nefficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. Al makes it possible to search in new languages, with multiple\\ninputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular products at\\nGoogle — including Lens and Translate — were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such as optical\\ncharacter recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build Al into numerous solutions that our\\ncustomers can use to develop Al-powered applications — including processing documents, images, and translation — to\\nunderstand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all these\\nexamples, Al significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to people and\\norganizations.\\n\\nOur view is that Al is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough Al\\ninnovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further advancements\\nthat will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity\\'s greatest challenges and opportunities.\\n\\nPrivacy and security\\n\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-\\nterm financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly\\nupholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people\\nin control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving\\nthem new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and\\npassword security features.\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\n\\nServing our users\\n\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in\\nthe world. Google Services\\' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive,\\nGoogle Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the\\nworld.\\n\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.\\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their\\ncomputer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to find what\\nthey are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new.\\n\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and\\ncreation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming\\nmany forms of digital content, including watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books,\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 6/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nand using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to\\nfind great digital content.\\n\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware. That is why we continue to\\ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well as\\ngrowing our family of hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people\\'s lives\\neasier by combining the best of our Al, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of\\nhardware products such as the new Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, and the very first Pixel Watch. Creating products that people\\nrely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\\n\\nHow we make money\\n\\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital\\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range\\nof products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the\\nright time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\\n\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on\\nGoogle Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners\\' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We\\ncontinue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so\\nadvertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n\\n* Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement\\nwith advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results.\\nOur ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n\\n¢ Brand advertising helps enhance users\\' awareness of and affinity for advertisers\\' products and services, through\\nvideos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver\\ndigital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\\n\\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We\\nfocus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out\\ninvalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos\\nwhere ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\n\\nWe continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube\\nsubscriptions, such as:\\n\\n* Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\\n\\n+ Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel\\ndevices.\\n\\n+ YouTube non-advertising generates subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\\n\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google\\nCloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity; data,\\nanalytics, Al, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect, protect, and\\nrespond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Our data cloud unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance,\\nand advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. We provide customers an\\nopen, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in\\ntheir data centers. Additionally, Google Workspace\\'s easy-to-use and secure communication and collaboration tools, which\\ninclude apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable secure hybrid work, boosting productivity and\\ncollaboration.\\n\\nOther Bets\\n\\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from\\nimproving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s investment in\\nthe portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D\\nphase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful\\nbusinesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 7/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with\\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries.\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n\\n* general purpose search engines and information services;\\n\\n+ vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may\\nnavigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n\\n* — online advertising platforms and networks;\\n\\n+ other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers\\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n\\n* — digital content and application platform providers;\\n+ providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n\\n* companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have\\ndeveloped proprietary platforms;\\n\\n* providers of digital video services;\\n\\n* — social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through\\ntraditional search engines;\\n\\n* — providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\\n+ — digital assistant providers.\\n\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies\\nto the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and\\nretaining:\\n\\n* users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of\\nour advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n\\n* advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their\\nadvertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n\\n* content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate\\nrevenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\\n\\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\\n\\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our\\ncore values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability\\nand climate change since Google’s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the\\npast two decades:\\n\\n+ In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\\n\\n+ In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy,\\nwhich we have achieved for five consecutive years.\\n\\n+ In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any\\ncompany in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally and\\nsocially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean\\ntransportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small\\nbusinesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net proceeds from our\\nsustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\\n\\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a\\ncircular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\\n\\n7\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 8/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nTo accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate\\naction, and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\\n\\n* achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware\\nproducts;\\n\\n+ become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a\\nyear;\\n\\n* enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\\n\\n+ help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon\\nemissions annually.\\n\\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to\\nenable others to do the same.\\n\\nWe are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We\\nintroduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower\\ncarbon footprints; and when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information\\nfrom authoritative sources like the United Nations.\\n\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by\\n2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing our\\nstewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving\\nwatershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone\\npredict, prevent, and recover from water stress. At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we\\nwill continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have\\nachieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\\n\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\\nGoogle’s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about risks\\nand uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nCulture and Workforce\\n\\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and\\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\\n\\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees can\\nhave fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to take care\\nof the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and development,\\nresources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive compensation\\nprograms help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting talented people to\\ntechnical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well.

Like other companies in the technology industry, we face heightened scrutiny from both\\nU.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of these laws and\\nregulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. Particularly with\\nregard to data privacy and security; content moderation; competition; consumer protection; climate change and\\nsustainability; and reporting on human capital and diversity, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and\\nregulations, as well as related enforcement actions, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative bodies\\naround the world.\\n\\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase\\nour cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models,\\ncause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an\\nadverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Item 1A;\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part Il, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nIntellectual Property\\n\\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our\\nproprietary technology and our brand.

RISK FACTORS\\n\\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those\\ndescribed below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the\\ntrading price of our Class A and Class C stock.\\n\\nRisks Specific to our Company\\n\\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss\\nof partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads\\ncould harm our business.\\n\\nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers, companies\\nthat distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at\\nany time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 10/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as\\nchanges to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the\\nadvertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more\\ndifficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these\\ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide\\nsuperior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic\\nconditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts\\nour advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are\\nuseful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies,\\nshifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately\\nanticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a\\ntimely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products\\nand services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance\\nour technology and new and existing products and services.\\n\\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors\\nrange from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and\\nwell established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our\\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D and in talent, initiating\\nintellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete for users, advertisers,\\ncustomers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known\\ncompetitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive\\nadvantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may\\nforesee the need for products and services before us.\\n\\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the\\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and existing\\ntechnologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen\\nto be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and\\nforce us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products\\nand services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users,\\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The\\ninvestments that we are making across our businesses, such as in Al, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide\\nproducts and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments\\nspan a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or\\nmay not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities.\\nThese endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management\\nattention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may\\nfail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\\n\\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and\\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of\\ntechnological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement\\nin performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be\\nno assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\\n\\n10\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 11/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services,\\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to\\nsupport cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force.\\nAt the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models\\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business\\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory\\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or\\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may\\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other\\ncountries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\\n\\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our\\nofferings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to\\ncompete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\\n\\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use Al, require significant investment and\\nraise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for\\nour products and services. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that\\nsuch strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating\\nmargin in the future.\\n\\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices\\nand modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in\\nadvertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our products\\nand services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.\\n\\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors,\\nsuch as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware,\\nGoogle Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins\\nlower than those we generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our hardware products have had, and may\\ncontinue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We\\nmay also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition,\\nand increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less\\nvariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in conjunction with our efforts to re-engineer\\ncosts, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or these efforts may not be successful. Due to these\\nfactors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not\\nbe indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics in Part Il, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our\\nproducts, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\\n\\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.\\nVarious events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services,\\nand technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our\\nproducts and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our\\nproprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is\\npossible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or\\ncopyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope\\nof the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\\n\\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other\\nsensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these\\ntrade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could\\nbecome so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that \"Google\" is\\na protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S.,\\n\\n11\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 12/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other\\npeople using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\\n\\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also,\\nprotecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our\\nintellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our\\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.\\n\\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the\\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch\\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content\\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors,\\nincluding, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues\\nand developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the\\nsharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by\\nadvertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.\\n\\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and\\noperating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide\\nhigh-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of\\nsettings.\\n\\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results.\\n\\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to\\nsupply both our products and our services.\\n\\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our hardware products and servers and networking\\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to\\nassemble the hardware products and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the distribution of our\\nproducts and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the\\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to\\nfinancial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements\\nwith them.\\n\\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead\\ntimes that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity,\\nlabor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and\\nexport controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the\\neffects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects\\nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes\\nin the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical\\ninfrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find\\nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that\\naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability.\\n\\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions.\\nWe may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change,\\nchanged consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of our\\nhardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware\\nsales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other\\nfinancial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and\\noperating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on\\nvolume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.\\n\\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing,\\nor operations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\\n\\n12\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 13/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nmanufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or\\nservices are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and\\npractices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security,\\nenvironmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of\\nlaw or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships,\\nand damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our\\nability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.\\n\\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications\\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing\\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage,\\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or\\npandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding,\\nheat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased\\nstorm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer\\ndenial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers\\nare located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to\\nbreak-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems\\nexperienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area.\\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The\\noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data\\ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and\\ncomplex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in\\ninterruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively\\noffering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition,\\nand operating results.\\n\\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow\\ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. In addition\\nto risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\\n\\n* restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us\\nfrom repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\\n\\n+ import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from\\noffering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies\\nand finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs;\\n\\n+ longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\\n\\n* an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new\\nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that\\nwe are unable to effectively anticipate;\\n\\n* sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to comply\\nwith local laws, including as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in\\nUkraine;\\n\\n+ political unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of our\\nproducts and services, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and\\nservices, or may impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market;\\n\\n+ anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain\\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\\n\\n13\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 14/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n* uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty as a result of local laws,\\ninsufficient due process, and lack of legal precedent; and\\n\\n+ — different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges\\ncaused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\\n\\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we\\nhave faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a\\nportion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and\\nforeign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could\\nexpose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial\\nstatements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time.\\n\\nThe fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively\\naffected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign\\nexchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark\\nrates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.\\n\\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based\\ncompensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business\\ncombination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation\\nmethods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. We\\nadjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or\\nsimilar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, are\\nrecognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). The unrealized gains\\nand losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may\\ndiffer significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments.\\n\\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and\\noperating results.\\n\\nRisks Related to our Industry\\n\\nPeople access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the\\nadvancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our\\nproducts and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.\\n\\nPeople access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones,\\nsmartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-\\nstreaming devices. Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor\\nmay establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only\\nbe available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers\\nmay also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-\\nactivated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges\\nwe may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We\\nexpect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple\\nplatforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers,\\ndistributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and\\nplatforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business\\nopportunities.\\n\\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation,\\ncause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products\\nand services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could\\nresult in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ and customers’ ability to\\nuse our products and services, harming our business and reputation.\\n\\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure,\\nor security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and\\nregulations regarding privacy and data change.\\n\\n14\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 15/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive\\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches\\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other\\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products\\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are\\nlikely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and may in\\nthe future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and control failures,\\nsecurity breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in\\ngovernment and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and\\nretain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature\\nof our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect\\nto continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and\\nsecurity vulnerabilities or breaches.\\n\\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis.\\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of\\ntime. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j\\nvulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to\\nexperience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may\\nalso increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-\\nsponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including\\nfederal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,\\nmay increase these risks.\\n\\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or\\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time\\nthey occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant\\nlegal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative\\npublicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the\\naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the techniques used to\\nobtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently\\nand often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including\\nthose required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or\\nvulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.\\n\\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our\\nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business\\npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would\\nbe harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised,\\nand we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action\\nlitigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business,\\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including\\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or\\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to\\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal,\\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related to\\nLaws, Regulations, and Policies’ below.\\n\\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our\\nplatforms and misuse of user data.\\n\\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety,\\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties,\\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. As a\\nresult of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to\\nor misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, and may in the\\nfuture not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including\\n\\n15\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 16/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors\\noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third\\nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our\\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad\\npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading\\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may\\nremedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and\\nreputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There is also\\nno guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they\\nmay not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.\\n\\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such\\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and\\nbrands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our\\nbusiness and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries,\\nwhich could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management\\'s time and attention, and lead to enhanced\\nregulatory oversight.\\n\\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content\\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our\\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\\n\\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated\\nattempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to\\notherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to\\npromote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been\\nunable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content.\\n\\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in\\nsearch results than our search engine\\'s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have\\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or\\nundesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most\\nother languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings.\\nWe continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for\\nspam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect\\nand prevent web spam on our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites,\\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their\\nsearch rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from low-quality\\nwebsites. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents\\nsuch as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and\\nthe spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\\n\\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it\\ncould hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition\\nand operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties\\nand damages and divert management\\'s time and attention.\\n\\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet\\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and\\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\\n\\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products\\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant\\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable\\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have\\ntaken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to\\ncertain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by\\ncharging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access.\\nSome jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers;\\nhowever, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in 2018 the\\nU.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit\\n\\n16\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 17/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In\\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or\\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content\\nproviders, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting\\nour business.\\n\\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies\\n\\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm\\nour business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to\\nexpand our business.\\n\\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our\\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws\\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws\\nand regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, and\\nonline content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.\\n\\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a\\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services,\\naltered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services,\\nsubstantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:\\n\\n* Competition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large technology\\nplatforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea and elsewhere\\nthat affect Google Play\\'s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under consideration in a\\nrange of jurisdictions.\\n\\n+ Data privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing,\\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the\\nprocessing of children\\'s data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data\\ntransfers (including data localization laws).\\n\\n+ Copyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on Copyright\\nin the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing\\nregimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create\\nproperty rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.\\n\\n* Content moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations,\\nsuch as the EU\\'s Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and laws and proposed\\nlegislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain\\ntypes of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may\\nmake it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or\\nharmful content.\\n\\n+ Consumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could\\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\n\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts, remain\\nuncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like\\nthose set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and\\nthe E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and\\nhosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose\\nsignificant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S. (such as Gonzalez v.\\nGoogle), EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online\\nplatforms.\\n\\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations,\\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our\\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders\\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our\\nplatforms, personal injury, and other matters. We also are subject to a variety of claims including\\n\\n17\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 18/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and\\nwe may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or\\nservice disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for\\ndefamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity,\\ntorts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or\\nvia our services or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content\\ncreated by third parties.\\n\\nFor example, the U.S. Department of Justice, various U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust\\nlawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and\\ndistribution of Google Search, and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other\\nregulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and\\ndata protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with\\nlaws and regulations. We are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation where appropriate. Various\\nlaws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past, and may in the future\\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our\\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other\\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and\\nother harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that\\nrequires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. The resolution of\\none or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties,\\ninjunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure or\\nalleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\n\\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals\\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have\\nresulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and\\ncould continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance\\nobligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in\\nways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include:\\n\\n+ The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which\\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or\\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the\\nmonitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\\n\\n+ Various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the\\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the\\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, all of which give new data privacy rights to\\ntheir respective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting\\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant\\nobligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\\n\\n+ State laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act\\nand the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that collect or\\ndisclose consumer biometric information.\\n\\n+ Various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children\\nand minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the Children’s\\nOnline Privacy Protection Act of 1998, the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, and the California Age\\nAppropriate Design Code, all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors\\nand impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.\\n\\n+ The California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with\\ninternet-connected devices.\\n\\n18\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 19/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ The EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data\\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other\\nchanges.\\n\\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we\\ncan transfer, process and/or receive personal data. Previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the EU-U.S. and\\nthe Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and storage, such\\nas Standard Contractual Clauses, remain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt our existing\\ncontractual arrangements. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and\\npolitical developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption of the U.S.-EU Data Privacy\\nFramework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and ongoing\\nenforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm our ability to\\nprocess and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our ability to provide,\\nand our customers’ ability to use, some of our products and services.\\n\\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use\\ncertain technologies.\\n\\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of\\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks.\\nParties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S.\\nInternational Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies\\nmay frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to\\nexpand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as\\nwe develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\\n\\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for\\nus and otherwise harm our business.\\n\\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against\\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property\\ninfringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if\\nthere were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our\\nproducts, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and\\nharm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not\\ncover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims.\\nFurthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification\\nfor certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits,\\nintellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are\\nsuccessful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\n\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to\\npotential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.\\n\\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to\\nmatters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords\\nrelating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and\\nformalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure\\nrequirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced\\na number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments,\\nand our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or\\nperformance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or\\nperceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and\\nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\n\\n19\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 20/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our\\neffective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different\\nstatutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management\\nprogram, decreases in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our\\ndeferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations,\\nor accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are unable or fail to collect\\ntaxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are\\nlevied against third parties.\\n\\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have\\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as\\ntransfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\\nharm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to\\nadditional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and\\nother tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our estimates are\\nreasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our\\nfinancial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\n\\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may\\nbe subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various jurisdictions\\naround the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted\\ntaxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for\\nEconomic Cooperation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules.\\n\\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock\\n\\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could\\ndiminish our cash reserves.\\n\\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with\\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further,\\nour share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be\\nsuspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\n\\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\\n\\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no\\nvoting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our\\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock.\\nThrough their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\\nincluding the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or\\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required\\nby applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund\\nemployee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to\\nelect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share\\nrepurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This\\nconcentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take\\nactions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock\\nand our Class C stock.\\n\\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders\\nmay consider favorable.\\n\\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\\n\\n+ Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of\\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n\\n* Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a\\nstockholders’ meeting.\\n\\n20\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 21/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of\\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\\n\\n+ Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to\\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a\\npotential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\\'s own slate of directors or otherwise\\nattempting to obtain control of our company.\\n\\n+ Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which\\nmakes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that\\ncould impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\\n\\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a\\ncorporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock\\nunless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the\\ntransaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\\n\\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile.\\n\\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In\\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated,\\nand may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including,\\namong others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world.\\nThese broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock,\\nregardless of our actual operating performance.\\n\\nGeneral Risks\\n\\nThe continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact are highly unpredictable and could be\\nsignificant, and could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur business, operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the\\nmacroeconomic impacts resulting from COVID-19, and as a result, our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage\\nof our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results may fall\\nbelow expectations. The extent to which our business will continue to be affected will depend on a variety of factors, many\\nof which are outside of our control, including the persistence of the pandemic, impacts on economic activity, and the\\npossibility of recession or continued financial market instability.\\n\\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results\\nto fall short of expectations.\\n\\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many\\noutside of our control, including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result,\\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may\\nnot be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. Consequently,\\nour operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.\\n\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and\\nother consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy\\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to\\ncontinue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could\\ncreate unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include:\\n\\n+ diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and\\nother strategic transactions;\\n\\n+ failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed\\nupon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise\\nrestrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\\n\\n+ failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural\\nintegration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;\\n\\n+ implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\\n\\n21\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 22/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ integration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of\\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\\n\\n+ transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\\n\\n+ in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to\\naddress the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\\n\\n+ failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments and joint ventures;\\n+ failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\\n\\n+ — liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement\\nclaims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims,\\nproduct liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\\n\\n+ — litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees,\\ncustomers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\\n\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions\\nand other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and\\nharm our business generally.\\n\\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the\\nincurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived\\nassets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Also, the\\nanticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. In connection with our\\ndivestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which\\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nIf we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\\n\\nOur future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management\\nteam. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an\\nimportant role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. All of our\\nexecutive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance\\npolicies. The loss of key personnel could harm our business.\\n\\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified\\npersonnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate\\neffectively.\\n\\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our ability to compete\\neffectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled\\npersonnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our\\ncompetitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. In addition, our compensation\\narrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and\\nretaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our\\nability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.\\n\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization\\ngrows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our\\ncorporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or\\npandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate\\nculture. As we experiment with hybrid work models, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to\\npotential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.\\n\\nITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\\nOPERATIONS\\n\\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with\\n“Note about Forward-Looking Statements,” Part |, tem 1 \"Business,\" Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our consolidated\\nfinancial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nWe have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item\\n7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\n\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google\\nServices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our\\nsegments, see Part |, Item 1 “Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\\n\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that\\nthey will continue to affect our future results:\\n\\n* Users\\' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\\n\\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues\\nsince inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues,\\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising\\nrevenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and\\nadvertisers, which may affect our revenues.\\n\\n« Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows\\nfor new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\\n\\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart\\nhome devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on\\nexpanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\\n\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may\\nbe affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased\\nmarket saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\n\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and\\nTAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix;\\npartner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the\\nrelative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\n\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n\\n« As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\\nmonetization.\\n\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand\\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads\\non YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop new products\\nincorporating Al innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when developing new products and\\nservices we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\\n\\n¢ As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates\\naffect such revenues.\\n\\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products\\nand advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\\n\\n26\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 27/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these\\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as\\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\n\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed\\nto reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\\n\\n* The revenues that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may\\nadversely affect our margins.\\n\\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our\\nproducts and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our\\nadvertising revenues. In particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to\\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n\\n* As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and\\ncapital expenditures.\\n\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to\\ndevelop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. We also expect to continue to\\ninvest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our\\nbusiness and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of Al. In addition acquisitions and strategic investments\\ncontribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and\\nbuild strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of\\nMandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.\\n\\n¢ We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our\\nbusiness practices and financial results.\\n\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range\\nof topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global\\ntrends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain\\nproducts or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples include the antitrust\\ncomplaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; pending litigation in the U.S.,\\nEU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the\\nDigital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large\\ntechnology platforms. For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part Il, Item 8.\\n\\n* Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\\n\\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring\\ntalented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see\\nCulture and Workforce in Part |, Item 1 “Business.”\\n\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\\n\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration\\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for\\nsubscription-based products. For details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nIn addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our revenues\\nhave been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:\\n\\n+ changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n* changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;\\n\\n* general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other\\nmeasures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;\\n\\n* new product and service launches; and\\n\\n27\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 28/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n* seasonality.\\n\\nAdditionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), revenues from other\\nsources (\"Google other revenues\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected\\nby other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.\\n\\nGoogle Services\\n\\nGoogle Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google other revenues.\\nGoogle Advertising\\n\\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\\n\\n* Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from\\ntraffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars,\\netc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n\\n+ YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\\n\\n* Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\n\\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising\\nrevenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-\\nper-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties.\\n\\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search\\nproperties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-\\nclick is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we\\ncharge advertisers for each engagement by users.\\n\\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob,\\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided\\nby our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression\\ndisplayed to users.\\n\\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and\\ncounting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the\\ncorresponding click and impression activity.\\n\\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search &\\nother properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the correlation\\nbetween these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:\\n\\n* advertiser competition for keywords;\\n* changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\\n* changes in device mix;\\n\\n* seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as\\ntraditional retail seasonality; and\\n\\n* — traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.\\nGoogle Other\\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\\n\\n* Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n\\n+ hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\\n\\n* YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV; and\\n\\n* — other products and services.\\n\\n28\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 29/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nFluctuations in our Google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as\\nchanges in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\\n* Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\\n\\n* Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises,\\nsuch as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\\n\\n+ — other enterprise services.\\n\\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as\\ncustomer usage.\\n\\nOther Bets\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\\nCosts and Expenses\\n\\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include\\ncosts related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions.

Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net\\npayments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of\\nstock.\\n\\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\n\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and\\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and\\nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\n\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through\\npurchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and\\nproducts.\\n\\nCapital Expenditures\\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n\\n+ technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing,\\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including Al, (collectively referred to as our\\ninformation technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n\\n* office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\\n\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been\\nplaced in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months\\nto years.

Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets\\nare completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and\\n2022, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $11.6 billion and $15.3 billion,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, we recognized total operating lease assets of $3.0 billion and\\n$4.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases,\\nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of 8 years, was $17.4 billion, of which $3.0 billion is short-term. As of\\nDecember 31, 2022, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and long-term lease\\npayments of $630 million and $3.1 billion that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These leases will\\ncommence between 2023 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of 1 to 25 years.\\n\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs)\\nwere $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31,\\n2021 and 2022. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for further information on leases.\\n\\nFinancing\\n\\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net\\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial\\npaper outstanding.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2023 and $6.0\\nbillion expiring in April 2026. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain\\nmarket rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have been\\nborrowed under the credit facilities.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion with\\nshort-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $3.8 billion, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our\\ndebt.\\n\\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and\\nhardware products we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then\\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. Certain\\nof these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented\\nas financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on From 10-\\nK.\\n\\nShare Repurchase Program\\n\\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class\\nA and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\\nrepurchases. In accordance with the authorization of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased and\\nsubsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired,\\n61 million shares were Class A stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were Class C stock for $52.6 billion. See Note\\n11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nEuropean Commission Fines\\n\\nIn 2017, 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European\\ncompetition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\\n2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. On September 14, 2022, the General Court\\nreduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of Justice. In\\n2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on\\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

As permitted\\nby the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have taxes payable\\nof $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022.\\n\\nPurchase Commitments\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3\\nbillion was short-term. These amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation\\nfee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network\\ncapacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any\\nminimum quantities and/or pricing as of December 31, 2022.\\n\\nIn addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy\\nattributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The\\namounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily\\ndeterminable.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates\\nand assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the\\ntime the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our\\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base\\nour estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we\\nevaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and\\nCompliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\\n\\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\\n\\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the\\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments\\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require\\nquantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Pricing\\nadjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best\\ninformation available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\\n\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the\\ncompanies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment\\nexist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an\\nincome approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee\\nrevenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative\\nremeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\\n\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may\\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of\\nunobservable inputs.\\n\\nProperty and Equipment\\n\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other\\nchanges occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and\\nutilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to\\nbenefit from the assets.\\n\\n39\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 40/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our\\nuncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\n\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable\\nand resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions\\nperiodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well\\nas the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain\\ntax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that\\nthe final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for\\nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\\n\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered\\nappropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of\\nour income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments\\nagainst us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to\\ndetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\n\\nLoss Contingencies\\n\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include\\nspeculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is\\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is\\nreasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has\\nbeen previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and\\nchanges to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the\\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to\\nloss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\\n\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\n\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in\\na change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result\\nin a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of December\\n31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and R&D expenses. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information relating to the useful lives of our servers\\nand network equipment.\\n\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and\\nequity investment risks.\\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\n\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses\\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.\\ndollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen.\\nFor the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency\\nexchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be\\nexperienced.\\n\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities\\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts reduce,\\nbut do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The\\nforeign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are\\noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\n\\n40\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 41/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $285 million and $136 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the\\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\\n\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts\\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these\\ncontracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate\\nchanges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into\\nrevenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\\n\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our\\ncash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021 and\\n2022. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in\\nforecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\n\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\\nrelated to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk\\nfrom our foreign operations.\\n\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million lower\\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a\\ncorresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain\\nliquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed\\nand asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we limit\\nthe amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning\\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due\\nto a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.\\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to\\ninterest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value\\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for which we\\nhave not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less\\nany expected credit losses.\\n\\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of\\nour marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and\\n2022 are shown below (in millions):\\n\\n12-Month Average\\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\\n\\n2021 2022 2021 2022\\nRisk category - interest rate $ 139 $ 256 $ 148 $ 198\\n\\n \\n\\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with\\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not\\nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\n\\nEquity Investment Risk\\n\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could\\nsubstantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\n\\n41\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 42/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\n\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\\nrepresent $7.8 billion and $5.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical\\nadverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity\\nsecurities by $516 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our\\nmarketable equity securities.\\n\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for\\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the\\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early\\nstages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically\\nin the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result\\nin a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity investments in private\\ncompanies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions at\\nlower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions could result in additional volatility.\\nThe success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize\\nappreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private sales or\\nother market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes\\nin valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the carrying value of our non-marketable\\nequity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $27.6 billion and $28.5 billion,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31,\\n2021 and 2022, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments could be impaired\\nif the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\n\\nFor further information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n42\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 43/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nITEM 8.

(the Company) as of December 31,\\n2021 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\\' equity and cash\\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement\\nschedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion,\\nthe consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at\\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period\\nended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\n\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion\\nthereon.\\n\\nBasis for Opinion\\n\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an\\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those\\nrisks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide\\na reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nCritical Audit Matter\\n\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements\\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\\ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex\\njudgments.

In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, in\\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO\\ncriteria.\\n\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 2, 2023\\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\n\\nBasis for Opinion\\n\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\'s\\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\\napplicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\\nmaintained in all material respects.\\n\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed\\nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\\nstatements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\nFebruary 2,

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\n\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the\\nsuccessor issuer to Google.\\n\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of\\nother products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based\\nproducts.\\n\\nBasis of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under\\nthe variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets,\\nand goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent\\nliabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to\\nbe reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\\nliabilities.\\n\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network\\nequipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\\n\\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one\\nstock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C\\nstock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of\\nour Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period\\nreferences made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable\\ndisclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the\\ncollectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar\\ntaxes are excluded from revenues.\\n\\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n\\n* Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who\\nuse Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n\\n* YouTube properties; and\\n\\n+ Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense,\\nand Google Ad Manager.\\n\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google\\nMarketing Platform, among others.\\n\\n52\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 53/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance\\nadvertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we\\nrecognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\\n\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a\\ngross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on\\nGoogle Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and\\namounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to\\nour customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n* Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\\n\\n* Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises,\\nsuch as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\\n\\n+ — other enterprise services.\\n\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms\\nlonger than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the\\ncustomer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided\\non a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits\\nof the cloud services.\\n\\nGoogle Other Revenues\\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\\n* Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n+ hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\\n\\n+ YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV; and\\n\\n+ other products and services.\\n\\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance\\nobligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\\n\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\n\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone\\nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\\n\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\n\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We\\nestimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe\\nthat there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\n\\nSales Commissions\\n\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is\\none year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to\\nexceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and\\nmarketing expenses.\\n\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n+ TAC includes:\\n\\n53\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 54/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\ne Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our\\ndistribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and\\nsoftware developers.\\n\\ne Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n+ Other cost of revenues includes:\\n\\n° Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other\\ncontent for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on\\nrevenues generated or a flat fee).\\n\\ne Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation,\\nenergy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as\\ncustomer and product support costs).\\n\\ne Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\n\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of\\nproducts to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological\\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the\\ncriteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were\\nnot material for the periods presented.\\n\\nStock-based Compensation\\n\\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified\\nand measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the\\nstraight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\n\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by\\nus on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income\\ntax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\n\\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs)\\nthat include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain\\nOther Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet\\nawards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based\\non the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\\n\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\n\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9 billion,\\nand $9.2 billion, respectively.\\n\\nPerformance Fees\\n\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in\\nexpense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of\\nunobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements\\n\\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is\\ndetermined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.

Where applicable,\\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\n\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\n\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation\\nmethods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\n\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\n\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain\\nOther Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\\n\\nCredit Risks\\n\\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, including\\nforeign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of\\nour counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are\\ntransacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are\\nderived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by\\nperforming ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do\\nnot require collateral from our customers.\\n\\nCash Equivalents\\n\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed\\nsecurities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\n\\nMarketable Securities\\n\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on\\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt\\nsecurities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and\\naccounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives,\\nas well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these\\nsecurities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months\\nas current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities\\nat fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for\\nthe changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other income (expense), net. For certain\\nmarketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in other\\nincome (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific\\nidentification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses,\\nincluding unrealized, recognized in other income (expense), net.

Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at\\ncost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for\\nidentical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as\\nof the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\\n\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\\nAccounts Receivable\\n\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or\\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services\\nand customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts\\nreceivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\\n\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of\\nIncome. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist\\nand on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining\\nthe amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make\\njudgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-\\nspecific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have commercial\\narrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements, whether the\\narrangements and each component of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the\\napplicable GAAP, as well as the determination of the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value\\nof the investments.\\n\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\\n\\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other\\nincome (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are\\nrecognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security\\nin an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other\\nindicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by\\nrecording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative\\nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\n\\n56\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 57/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nInventory\\n\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\\n\\nVariable Interest Entities\\n\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the\\nprimary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or\\nbenefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in\\naccordance with applicable GAAP.\\n\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of\\nwhether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\\n\\nProperty and Equipment\\n\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data\\ncenters, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment.\\nConstruction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\\nservice.\\n\\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We\\ndepreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over\\nperiods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We depreciate\\nleasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\\nDepreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences\\nonce they are ready for our intended use.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease\\ncomponents. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include\\npayments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and\\naccount for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\\n\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease\\nassets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on\\nwind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\\n\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and\\nin economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or\\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-\\ncancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease\\npayments and lease incentives.\\n\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included\\nin operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are\\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\n\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\\n\\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest\\nlevel of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by\\n\\n57\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 58/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to\\ngenerate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as\\nthe amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate\\nour reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually,\\nor more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments\\nwere not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis generally\\nover periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross intangible\\nassets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events\\nthat have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all\\navailable evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that\\nthey will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as\\na current period expense.\\n\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical\\nmerits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial\\nstatements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon\\nsettlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a\\ncomponent of the income tax provision.\\n\\nBusiness Combinations\\n\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-\\nrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\n\\nForeign Currency\\n\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity.\\nWe reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to\\nfunctional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense), net.\\n\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\n\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\\n\\n58\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 59/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have\\nnot yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely\\ndriven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which\\ncould affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize\\napproximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized\\nthereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced\\nin future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\n\\nDeferred Revenue\\n\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including\\namounts which are refundable.

The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to\\nimpairment are classified within Level 3.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, included in the $28.5 billion of non-marketable equity securities held as of\\nthe end of the period, $14.1 billion were measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 2 investments.\\n\\n61\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 62/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nDebt Securities\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt\\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2022\\nDue in 1 year or less $ 8,170\\nDue in 1 year through 5 years 51,698\\nDue in 5 years through 10 years 16,083\\nDue after 10 years 11,580\\nTotal $ 87,531\\n\\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by investment\\ncategory and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2021\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLess than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total\\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\\nFair Value Loss Fair Value Loss Fair Value Loss\\nGovernment bonds $ 32,843 $ (236) $ 71° $ (2) $ 32,914 $ (238)\\nCorporate debt securities 22,737 (152) 303 (5) 23,040 (157)\\nMortgage-backed and asset-\\nbacked securities 11,502 (106) 248 (6) 11,750 (112)\\nTotal $ 67,082 $ (494) $ 622 $ (13) $ 67,704 $ (507)\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\nLess than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total\\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\\nFair Value Loss Fair Value Loss Fair Value Loss\\nGovernment bonds $ 21,039 $ (1,004) $ 13,438 $ (1,041) $ 34477 $ (2,045)\\nCorporate debt securities 11,228 (440) 15,125 (1,052) 26,353 (1,492)\\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed\\nsecurities 7,725 (585) 6,964 (657) 14,689 (1,242)\\nTotal $ 39,992 §$ (2,029) $ 35,527 $ (2,750) $ 75,519 $ (4,779)\\n\\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification\\nmethod.The following table summarizes gains and losses for debt securities, reflected as a component of other income\\n(expense), net (in millions):\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2020 2021 2022\\nUnrealized gain (loss) on fair value option debt securities” $ 86 $ (122) $ (557)\\nGross realized gain on debt securities 899 432 103\\nGross realized loss on debt securities (184) (329) (1,588)\\n(Increase)/decrease in allowance for credit losses (76) (91) (22)\\nTotal gain (loss) on debt securities recognized in other income\\n(expense), net $ 725 $ (110) $ (2,064)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n“) Accumulated unrealized net gains (losses) related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were\\n$87 million, $(35) million, and $(592) million as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.\\n\\n62\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 63/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nEquity Investments\\n\\nThe carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss).

See Note 7 for further details on\\nother income (expense), net.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\n\\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk\\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and\\ninvestment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter\\ninto derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\n\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives\\nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The\\naccounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\n\\nCash Flow Hedges\\n\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain\\nforecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have maturities of\\n24 months or less.\\n\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently\\nreclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from\\nour assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in\\nrevenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\\nrecorded in AOCI.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was\\n$171 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\n\\nFair Value Hedges\\n\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and\\nlosses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize\\nchanges in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\\n\\nNet Investment Hedges\\n\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge\\neffectiveness are recognized in AOC! along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward points\\nfrom the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income\\n(expense), net.\\n\\nOther Derivatives\\n\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to hedge\\nintercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional\\ncurrency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges are primarily\\nrecorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and\\nliabilities.\\n\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, commodity\\nprices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the\\nmarket price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.

We have agreed to hold certain\\nparties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an\\nindemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\\n\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments\\nwe have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or\\nfinancial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could\\nbe significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\\npossible.\\n\\nLegal Matters\\n\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated,\\nwe disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of\\nliability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\\nadjustments as appropriate.\\n\\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant judgment\\nis required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such\\nmatters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding\\nlegal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in\\naggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\n\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Investigations\\n\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-\\nrelated complaints against us.\\n\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and\\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion\\n($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on\\nSeptember 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC\\'s decision. We\\nrecognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the General Court\\nrejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.\\n\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution\\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018)\\nfine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on\\nOctober 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the\\nGeneral Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court\\nof Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had\\nwith AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7\\nbillion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners\\' agreements, which we\\nimplemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized\\na charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by\\nregulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. For example:\\n\\n74\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 75/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n+ In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our\\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that\\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the Australian\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom\\'s Competition and Markets Authority\\n(CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n\\n* On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\\nfor the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade\\nlaws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state\\nAttorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate\\nU.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s advertising\\ntechnology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\\n\\n* On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust\\nlaws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened\\ninvestigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play\\'s billing\\npractices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google\\'s compliance with the new app store\\nbilling regulations.\\n\\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with\\nfederal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\n\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\n\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our\\nbusiness practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and\\notherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an\\nimportant forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition\\non importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could\\nhave an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or\\nnecessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain\\nintellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may\\nrequire that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and\\npartners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which\\ncould result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders\\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment,\\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our\\nplatforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently have a number of privacy\\ninvestigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to\\nrelevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other\\nproceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and\\nauditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and\\ncollateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties\\nhave been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of\\nsanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\n\\n75\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 76/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nNon-Income Taxes\\n\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The\\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale\\nof our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-\\nincome taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss\\nis probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can\\nbe estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters\\nand judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.\\n\\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14.\\nNote 11. Stockholders’ Equity\\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\\n\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C\\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to\\nvoting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is\\nentitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of\\nClass B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale\\nor transfer to Class A common stock.\\n\\nStock Split\\n\\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the\\nform of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company\\'s Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior\\nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and\\napplicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for further\\ndetails.\\n\\nShare Repurchases\\n\\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class\\nA and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share\\nrepurchases.\\n\\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022\\n\\nShares Amount Shares Amount\\nClass A share repurchases 24 $ 3,399 61 $ 6,719\\nClass C share repurchases 383 46,875 469 52,577\\nTotal share repurchases 407 $ 50,274 530 $ 59,296\\n\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its\\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices\\nand volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business\\nand market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated\\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\\n\\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\\n\\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities\\noutstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted\\nearnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of\\nClass A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\\nassume the conversion of those shares.\\n\\n76\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 77/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are\\nidentical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share\\ndividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our\\ncertificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given\\nclass of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our\\ncertificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be\\napproved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\n\\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders’ letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do\\nnot intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle\\nbig problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in artificial intelligence (Al). We continue this\\nwork under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\\n\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google\\nServices and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s structure is\\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence.\\n\\nAccess and technology for everyone'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './alphabet/alp_data.pdf'}, page_content=\"Access and technology for everyone\\n\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and small.\\nOur mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was\\nwhen we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a\\ncompany that also helps people get things done.\\n\\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools they\\nneed to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information and make\\nsense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. YouTube provides\\npeople with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant offers the best way to\\nget things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a person's day, no matter where\\nthey are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock\\nnew growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users,\\npartners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion in research and development in the last\\nfive years in support of these efforts.\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 5/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nMoonshots\\n\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This\\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not\\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but\\nthose efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. We\\ncontinue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the original\\nfounders’ letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the key to our\\nlong-term success.\\n\\nThe power of Al\\n\\nWe believe that Al is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful benefits\\nto people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of\\nhuman endeavor. As an information and computer science company, we will continue to be at the forefront of advancing\\nthe frontier of Al. Through our path-breaking and field-defining research and development, we responsibly and boldly\\ndevelop more capable and useful Al every day.\\n\\nAl already powers Google’s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of our\\ncore ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run effective and\\nefficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. Al makes it possible to search in new languages, with multiple\\ninputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular products at\\nGoogle — including Lens and Translate — were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such as optical\\ncharacter recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build Al into numerous solutions that our\\ncustomers can use to develop Al-powered applications — including processing documents, images, and translation — to\\nunderstand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries. In all these\\nexamples, Al significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to people and\\norganizations.\\n\\nOur view is that Al is now, and more than ever, critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough Al\\ninnovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further advancements\\nthat will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity's greatest challenges and opportunities.\\n\\nPrivacy and security\\n\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are near-\\nterm financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; strictly\\nupholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that put people\\nin control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete their data, giving\\nthem new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and\\npassword security features.\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\n\\nServing our users\\n\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people\\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in\\nthe world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive,\\nGoogle Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the\\nworld.\\n\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago.\\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using their\\ncomputer or mobile device, their own voice, a photo, or an image, making it quicker, easier, and more natural to find what\\nthey are looking for. Of the searches we see every day, 15% are new.\\n\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and\\ncreation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are consuming\\nmany forms of digital content, including watching videos, playing games, listening to music, reading books,\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 6/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nand using apps.

Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range\\nof products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the\\nright time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies.\\n\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on\\nGoogle Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners\\' properties (\"Google Network properties\"). We\\ncontinue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so\\nadvertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n\\n* Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement\\nwith advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results.\\nOur ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n\\n¢ Brand advertising helps enhance users\\' awareness of and affinity for advertisers\\' products and services, through\\nvideos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver\\ndigital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.\\n\\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We\\nfocus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering out\\ninvalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos\\nwhere ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\n\\nWe continue to focus on growing revenues beyond advertising, from Google Play, hardware, and YouTube\\nsubscriptions, such as:\\n\\n* Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases.\\n\\n+ Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel\\ndevices.\\n\\n+ YouTube non-advertising generates subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud\\n\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including Google\\nCloud Platform and Google Workspace. Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity; data,\\nanalytics, Al, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Our cybersecurity products help customers detect, protect, and\\nrespond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Our data cloud unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance,\\nand advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. We provide customers an\\nopen, reliable, and scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in\\ntheir data centers. Additionally, Google Workspace\\'s easy-to-use and secure communication and collaboration tools, which\\ninclude apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable secure hybrid work, boosting productivity and\\ncollaboration.\\n\\nOther Bets\\n\\nAcross Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from\\nimproving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s investment in\\nthe portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D\\nphase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful\\nbusinesses.

While these early-stage businesses naturally come with\\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries.\\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable\\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n\\n* general purpose search engines and information services;\\n\\n+ vertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users may\\nnavigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n\\n* — online advertising platforms and networks;\\n\\n+ other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers\\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n\\n* — digital content and application platform providers;\\n+ providers of enterprise cloud services;\\n\\n* companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have\\ndeveloped proprietary platforms;\\n\\n* providers of digital video services;\\n\\n* — social networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through\\ntraditional search engines;\\n\\n* — providers of workspace communication and connectivity products; and\\n+ — digital assistant providers.\\n\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies\\nto the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and\\nretaining:\\n\\n* users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of\\nour advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n\\n* advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their\\nadvertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n\\n* content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate\\nrevenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\\n\\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\\n\\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of our\\ncore values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on sustainability\\nand climate change since Google’s founding more than 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over the\\npast two decades:\\n\\n+ In 2007, we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations.\\n\\n+ In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewable energy,\\nwhich we have achieved for five consecutive years.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './alphabet/alp_data.pdf'}, page_content='+ In 2020, we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any\\ncompany in history at the time. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally and\\nsocially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, clean\\ntransportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and support for small\\nbusinesses and COVID-19 crisis response. As of 2022, we had fully allocated the net proceeds from our\\nsustainability bonds as outlined in our Sustainability Bond Impact Report published in 2022.\\n\\nOur sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars: accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a\\ncircular economy, empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and places where we operate.\\n\\n7\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 8/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nTo accelerate the transition to a carbon-free and circular economy, in 2020, we launched our third decade of climate\\naction, and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals. By 2030, we aim to:\\n\\n* achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, including our consumer hardware\\nproducts;\\n\\n+ become the first major company to run on carbon-free energy 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a\\nyear;\\n\\n* enable 5 gigawatts of new carbon-free energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions; and\\n\\n+ help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton (one billion tons) of carbon\\nemissions annually.\\n\\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and to\\nenable others to do the same.\\n\\nWe are committed to helping people make more sustainable choices by empowering them with technology. We\\nintroduced eco-friendly routing in Google Maps; new features to book flights or purchase appliances that have lower\\ncarbon footprints; and when people come to Google Search with questions about climate change, we show information\\nfrom authoritative sources like the United Nations.\\n\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by\\n2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate. We are focused on three areas: enhancing our\\nstewardship of water resources across Google offices and data centers; replenishing our water use and improving\\nwatershed health and ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools that help everyone\\npredict, prevent, and recover from water stress. At Google we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, and we\\nwill continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet. We are proud of what we have\\nachieved so far, and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all.\\n\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including\\nGoogle’s Environmental Report.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss\\nof partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads\\ncould harm our business.\\n\\nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers, companies\\nthat distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at\\nany time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 10/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective\\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as\\nchanges to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the\\nadvertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more\\ndifficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these\\ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide\\nsuperior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\n\\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic\\nconditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts\\nour advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are\\nuseful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies,\\nshifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately\\nanticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a\\ntimely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products\\nand services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance\\nour technology and new and existing products and services.\\n\\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors\\nrange from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and\\nwell established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our\\ncompetitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D and in talent, initiating\\nintellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete for users, advertisers,\\ncustomers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known\\ncompetitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive\\nadvantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may\\nforesee the need for products and services before us.\"),\n",

As new and existing\\ntechnologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen\\nto be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and\\nforce us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products\\nand services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users,\\nadvertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results.\\n\\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and\\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The\\ninvestments that we are making across our businesses, such as in Al, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide\\nproducts and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers.

We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to\\nsupport cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force.\\nAt the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models\\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business\\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory\\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or\\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may\\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other\\ncountries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.\\n\\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among\\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our\\nofferings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to\\ncompete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\\n\\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use Al, require significant investment and\\nraise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for\\nour products and services.

In particular, margins on our hardware products have had, and may\\ncontinue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We\\nmay also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition,\\nand increasing costs for many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less\\nvariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, in conjunction with our efforts to re-engineer\\ncosts, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or these efforts may not be successful. Due to these\\nfactors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not\\nbe indicative of our future performance.

We also rely on other companies to participate in the distribution of our\\nproducts and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the\\nnecessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to\\nfinancial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements\\nwith them.\\n\\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead\\ntimes that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity,\\nlabor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and\\nexport controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the\\neffects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects\\nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes\\nin the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical\\ninfrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find\\nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that\\naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability.\\n\\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions.\\nWe may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change,\\nchanged consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues.

Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and ongoing\\nenforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm our ability to\\nprocess and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our ability to provide,\\nand our customers’ ability to use, some of our products and services.\\n\\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend,\\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use\\ncertain technologies.\\n\\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of\\ninfringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks.\\nParties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S.\\nInternational Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-holding companies\\nmay frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we continue to\\nexpand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as\\nwe develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.\\n\\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing\\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or\\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain\\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for\\nus and otherwise harm our business.\\n\\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against\\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property\\ninfringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if\\nthere were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our\\nproducts, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and\\nharm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not\\ncover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims.\\nFurthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification\\nfor certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless of their merits,\\nintellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims are\\nsuccessful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating\\nresults.\\n\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to\\npotential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.\\n\\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to\\nmatters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords\\nrelating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and\\nformalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure\\nrequirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced\\na number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments,\\nand our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or\\nperformance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or\\nperceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and\\nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results.\\n\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\n\\n19\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 20/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.

Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and\\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Further,\\nour share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be\\nsuspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.\\n\\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\\n\\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has no\\nvoting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our\\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock.\\nThrough their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\\nincluding the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or\\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no voting rights (except as required\\nby applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund\\nemployee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to\\nelect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share\\nrepurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power.

For further details on our\\nsegments, see Part |, Item 1 “Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\\n\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that\\nthey will continue to affect our future results:\\n\\n* Users\\' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\\n\\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues\\nsince inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues,\\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising\\nrevenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and\\nadvertisers, which may affect our revenues.\\n\\n« Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows\\nfor new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\\n\\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart\\nhome devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on\\nexpanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\\n\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may\\nbe affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased\\nmarket saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\n\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and\\nTAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix;\\npartner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the\\nrelative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\n\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n\\n« As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\\nmonetization.\\n\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand\\nour product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, revenues from ads\\non YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may develop new products\\nincorporating Al innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when developing new products and\\nservices we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\\n\\n¢ As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates\\naffect such revenues.\\n\\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India.

The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our\\nadvertising revenues.

In addition acquisitions and strategic investments\\ncontribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and\\nbuild strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we closed the acquisition of\\nMandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.\\n\\n¢ We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our\\nbusiness practices and financial results.'),\n",

When indicators of impairment\\nexist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an\\nincome approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee\\nrevenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. When the quantitative\\nremeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.\\n\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e.\\nperformance fees.

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of\\nour income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments\\nagainst us.

The\\nforeign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are\\noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\n\\n40\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 41/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and\\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have\\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $285 million and $136 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the\\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2022.\\n\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a\\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in\\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option\\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign\\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts\\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these\\ncontracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate\\nchanges as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them into\\nrevenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\\n\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our\\ncash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion lower for both December 31, 2021 and\\n2022. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in\\nforecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\n\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\\nrelated to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk\\nfrom our foreign operations.\\n\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI\\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $975 million and $903 million lower\\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a\\ncorresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain\\nliquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed\\nand asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate derivatives. By policy, we limit\\nthe amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning\\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due\\nto a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.\\nUnrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to\\ninterest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities, we have elected the fair value\\noption for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We measure securities for which we\\nhave not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold, less\\nany expected credit losses.\\n\\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of\\nour marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our\\ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95%\\nconfidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and\\n2022 are shown below (in millions):\\n\\n12-Month Average\\nAs of December 31, As of December 31,\\n\\n2021 2022 2021 2022\\nRisk category - interest rate $ 139 $ 256 $ 148 $ 198\\n\\n \\n\\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the\\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with\\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not\\nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\n\\nEquity Investment Risk\\n\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could\\nsubstantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\n\\n41\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 42/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are\\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\n\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily\\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and\\nrepresent $7.8 billion and $5.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical\\nadverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2022 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity\\nsecurities by $516 million.

The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an\\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the early\\nstages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically\\nin the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result\\nin a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\n\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the\\nsuccessor issuer to Google.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './alphabet/alp_data.pdf'}, page_content='We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of\\nother products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based\\nproducts.\\n\\nBasis of Consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under\\nthe variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\n\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets,\\nand goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and contingent\\nliabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to\\nbe reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\\nliabilities.\\n\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and\\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network\\nequipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year 2023.\\n\\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\\n\\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-one\\nstock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and Class C\\nstock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value per share of\\nour Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. All prior period\\nreferences made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable\\ndisclosures prior to the effective date have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the\\ncollectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar\\ntaxes are excluded from revenues.\\n\\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n\\n* Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who\\nuse Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n\\n* YouTube properties; and\\n\\n+ Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense,\\nand Google Ad Manager.\\n\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, and Google\\nMarketing Platform, among others.\\n\\n52\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000 165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 53/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance\\nadvertising when a user engages with the advertisement, such as a click, a view, or a purchase. For brand advertising, we\\nrecognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\\n\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a\\ngross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on\\nGoogle Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and\\namounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the\\nadvertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to\\nour customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n* Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\\n\\n* Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises,\\nsuch as Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet; and\\n\\n+ — other enterprise services.\\n\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms\\nlonger than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the\\ncustomer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided\\non a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits\\nof the cloud services.\\n\\nGoogle Other Revenues\\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\\n* Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n+ hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices;\\n\\n+ YouTube non-advertising, which includes subscription revenues from services such as YouTube Premium and\\nYouTube TV; and\\n\\n+ other products and services.\\n\\nWe report revenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance\\nobligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee.\\n\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\n\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate\\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone\\nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\\n\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\n\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We\\nestimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe\\nthat there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\n\\nSales Commissions\\n\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is\\none year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to\\nexceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and\\nmarketing expenses.\\n\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n+ TAC includes:\\n\\n53'),\n",

Technological\\nfeasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the\\ncriteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and\\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software\\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the\\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were\\nnot material for the periods presented.\\n\\nStock-based Compensation\\n\\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified\\nand measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the\\nstraight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\n\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by\\nus on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income\\ntax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\n\\nAdditionally, stock-based compensation includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs)\\nthat include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets. PSUs and certain\\nOther Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain Other Bet\\nawards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of Other Bet awards is based\\non the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet.\\n\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\n\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.4 billion, $7.9 billion,\\nand $9.2 billion, respectively.\\n\\nPerformance Fees\\n\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain\\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in\\nexpense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of\\nunobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nFair Value Measurements\\n\\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is\\ndetermined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.

Where applicable,\\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based\\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\n\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\n\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation\\nmethods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\n\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents,\\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets\\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and\\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\n\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain\\nOther Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments\\n\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative\\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\\n\\nCredit Risks\\n\\nWe are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, including\\nforeign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of\\nour counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are\\ntransacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are\\nderived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by\\nperforming ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do\\nnot require collateral from our customers.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './alphabet/alp_data.pdf'}, page_content=\"Cash Equivalents\\n\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed\\nsecurities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\n\\nMarketable Securities\\n\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of\\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on\\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt\\nsecurities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and\\naccounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives,\\nas well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these\\nsecurities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months\\nas current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities\\nat fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for\\nthe changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in other income (expense), net.

Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at\\ncost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for\\nidentical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as\\nof the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nNon-marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\\n\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\\nAccounts Receivable\\n\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or\\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services\\nand customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts\\nreceivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\\n\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts\\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of\\nIncome. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist\\nand on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining\\nthe amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make\\njudgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-\\nspecific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have commercial\\narrangements. For these transactions, judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements, whether the\\narrangements and each component of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the\\napplicable GAAP, as well as the determination of the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value\\nof the investments.\\n\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\\n\\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is\\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past\\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other\\nincome (expense), net, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are\\nrecognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security\\nin an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.\\n\\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment\\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other\\nindicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by\\nrecording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. We prepare quantitative\\nmeasurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\n\\n56\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 57/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nInventory\\n\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.

       " Document(metadata={'source': './alphabet/alp_data.pdf'}, page_content='Variable Interest Entities\\n\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in\\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the\\nprimary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most\\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or\\nbenefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in\\naccordance with applicable GAAP.\\n\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of\\nwhether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.\\n\\nProperty and Equipment\\n\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets,\\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data\\ncenters, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment.\\nConstruction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in\\nservice.\\n\\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. We\\ndepreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over\\nperiods of four to five years (generally, four years for servers and five years for network equipment). We depreciate\\nleasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\\nDepreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences\\nonce they are ready for our intended use.\\n\\nLeases\\n\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease\\ncomponents. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include\\npayments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and\\naccount for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\\n\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease\\nassets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on\\nwind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\\n\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease\\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our\\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental\\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and\\nin economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or\\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-\\ncancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease\\npayments and lease incentives.\\n\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our\\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included\\nin operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are\\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\n\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\\n\\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest\\nlevel of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets.

If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as\\nthe amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate\\nour reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units,\\nwe reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually,\\nor more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments\\nwere not material for the periods presented.\\n\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis generally\\nover periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross intangible\\nassets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events\\nthat have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all\\navailable evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that\\nthey will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as\\na current period expense.\\n\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical\\nmerits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial\\nstatements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon\\nsettlement with a taxing authority.

Additionally, the payments\\nwe have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or\\nfinancial position.

If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated,\\nwe disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of\\nliability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make\\nadjustments as appropriate.\"),\n",

On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and on\\nSeptember 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. We\\nrecognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.

The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018)\\nfine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on\\nOctober 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the\\nGeneral Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court\\nof Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\\n\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had\\nwith AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7\\nbillion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we\\nimplemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending. We recognized\\na charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\n\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by\\nregulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.

The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that\\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the Australian\\nCompetition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority\\n(CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n\\n* On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court\\nfor the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade\\nlaws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state\\nAttorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate\\nU.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising\\ntechnology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively.\\n\\n* On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust\\nlaws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened\\ninvestigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing\\npractices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store\\nbilling regulations.\\n\\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with\\nfederal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\n\\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\n\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our\\nbusiness practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and\\notherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an\\nimportant forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition\\non importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could\\nhave an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or\\nnecessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\n\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain\\nintellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may\\nrequire that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and\\npartners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which\\ncould result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\n\\nOther\"),\n",

The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to\\nvoting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is\\nentitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of\\nClass B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale\\nor transfer to Class A common stock.\\n\\nStock Split\\n\\nOn July 15, 2022, the company executed a 20-for-one stock split with a record date of July 1, 2022, effected in the\\nform of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company's Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. All prior\\nperiod references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and\\napplicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for further\\ndetails.\\n\\nShare Repurchases\\n\\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class\\nA and Class C shares.

Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business\\nand market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated\\ntransactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\\n\\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\\n\\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities\\noutstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted\\nearnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of\\nClass A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not\\nassume the conversion of those shares.\\n\\n76\\n\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204423000016/goog-20221231.htm 77/92\\n\\x0c12/8/24, 10:15 PM goog-20221231\\n\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n\\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are\\nidentical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share\\ndividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our\\ncertificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given\\nclass of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our\\ncertificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be\\napproved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are\\nallocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the earnings for the\\nyear had been distributed.
